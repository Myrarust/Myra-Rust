## Mobile Game Market Analysis
This project provides analysis on Google's mobile game market. The main focus of this project was to gather data from different data sources; a csv file, tabular data scraped from a website, and retrieving data using an API. All three data sources were then combined and inserted into a database. Then the data was used to conduct analysis and provide statistics surrounding Google game reviews, ratings, and revenue.

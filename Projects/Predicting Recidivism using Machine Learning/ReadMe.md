## Predicting Recidivism using Machine Learning
Again, and again, you read news articles or watch television programs about persons who were previously incarcerated, committing additional criminal acts after being released from prison. The question that we ask ourselves is, could these additional crimes have been prevented? This project evaluates the performance of machine learning models to predict recidivism rates based off of demographic information. If we could determine who is likely to reoffend, this information could be used to make better decisions on initial sentence lengths or at parole release boards.

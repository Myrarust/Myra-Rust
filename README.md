# Hi! I'm Myra Rust.
Welcome to my technical portfolio!

## About Me
I am an aspiring data scientist looking to leverage my past experience and current education in a new and exciting career. I discovered data science after leaving my career in software integration, test, and QA to be a stay-at-home mom for my wonderful daughter and I fell in love with it! Data science compliments my natural analytical personality and I enjoy using technology and machine learning to solve problems and provide answers.

## Project Folder 
The projects folder contains work from some of my favorite projects I completed during my Data Science Masterâ€™s program. Take a look at the ReadMe files and if you see a topic that piques your interest, feel free to take a look at the project deliverables and code located in the folder. Enjoy!

## About Me

I am an aspiring data scientist looking to leverage my past experience and current education in a new and exciting career. I discovered data science after leaving my career in software integration, test, and QA to be a stay-at-home mom for my wonderful daughter and I fell in love with it! Data science compliments my natural analytical personality and I enjoy using technology and machine learning to solve problems and provide answers. 

<br><br>**Skills:** Data Science, Statistical Data Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization, Software Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Software QA, Requirements Gathering and Traceability.<br>

**Languages:** Python, R, SQL, UNIX<br>

**Software packages/platforms:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Keras, Tensorflow, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GGPlot2, Tableau, Github, Juypter Notebooks, Jira, Microsoft Office.

         If you have read the book Blink by Malcolm Gladwell, then you might be familiar with Dr. John Gottman who is renowned in the field of psychology for being able to predict couples that will divorce with an accuracy rate of ~94%. But can machine beat man at this prediction game? This project uses data science and logistic regression to analyze survey data and make predictions on what couples will get divorced with a final accuracy score of 98%! </p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/ASL%20Image%20Classification">ASL Image Classification</a></h3>
      <p>
         This project utilizes machine learning techniques to test computer vision capabilities on human hand pose images. Using Keras and Tensorflow to create a convolutional neural network to predict the letter value from a 2D imag of a hand pose. The model achievied an accuracy score of 92.1%. This is a significant accomplishment and could lead to further work incorporating machine learning models to provide real-time interpretation of sign language.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/Forecasting%20Workplace%20Absenteeism">Forecasting Workplace Absenteeism</a></h3>
      <p>
         This project leveraged historical data, machine learning, and predictive modeling to forecast how many hours an employee will be absent based on demographic information. In this project multiple models were evaluated and performance was measured on regression performance statistics. The best performing model was able to account for 4.3% of target variance. This result is not optimal and indicates that the demographic information provided is not sufficient to make accurate forecasts. However, analysis did identify a potential alternate forecasting model that could be used to make more accurate forecasts.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/Airline%20Safety%20Visualization%20Analysis">Airline Saftey Visualization Analysis</a></h3>
      <p>
         Project Scenario: A slew of recent airline accidents had people worried about airline safety. As a person employed for an airline, I was tasked with creating a number of visualizations that could be used to tell the true story of airline safety to different audiences. Project deliverables include: a blog post, an infographic, an executive summary, and a final presentation for management.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Colorado%20Air%20Quality%20Index">Exploratory Analsis of Colorado's Air Quality Index</a></h3>
      <p>
         As a nation, we continue to become more aware of environmental issues like pollution. The government imposes environmental standards to help mitigate pollution and there has been a huge movement in both the public and private sectors, towards clean energy sources like electric, solar, and wind power. But are we making an impact? This project uses exploratory data analysis techniques to prove that pollution levels in Colorado are decreasing over time.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/Predicting%20Recidivism%20using%20Machine%20Learning">Predicting Recidivism using Machine Learning</a></h3>
      <p>
         Again, and again, you read news articles or watch television programs about persons who were previously incarcerated, committing additional criminal acts after being released from prison. The question that we ask ourselves is, could these additional crimes have been prevented? This project evaluates the performance of machine learning models to predict recidivism rates based off of demographic information. If we could determine who is likely to reoffend, this information could be used to make better decisions  on initial sentence lengths or at parole release boards.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/Statistical%20Analysis%20of%20IVF%20Success%20Rates">Statistical Analysis of IVF Success Rates</a></h3>
      <p>
         Many women have difficulty becoming pregnant and look to assisted reproductive procedures to help with conceiving a child. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of the procedures available. The IVF process is a very expensive. This project utilized R programming language to conduct statistical analysis on IVF success rates and factors to help an individual make decisions on whether in vitro fertilization is a good choice for them.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Myrarust/Myra-Rust/tree/main/Projects/Mobile%20Game%20Market%20Analysis">Mobile Game Market Analysis</a></h3>
      <p>
         This project provides analysis on Google's mobile game market. The main focus of this project was to gather data from different data sources; a csv file, tabular data scraped from a website, and retrieving data using an API. All three data sources were then combined and inserted into a database. Then the data was used to conduct analysis and provide statistics surrounding Google game reviews, ratings, and revenue.</p>

      <h3>Airline Saftey Visualization Analysis</h3>
      <p>
         Project Scenario: A slew of recent airline accidents had people worried about airline safety. As a person employed for an airline, I was tasked with creating a number of visualizations that could be used to tell the true story of airline safety to different audiences. Project deliverables include: a blog post, an infographic, an executive summary, and a final presentation for management.

      <h3>Statistical Analysis of IVF Success Rates</h3>
      <p>
         Many women have difficulty becoming pregnant and look to assisted reproductive procedures to help with conceiving a child. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of the procedures available. During the IVF procedure, an egg is retrieved from the woman, fertilized in a laboratory, then the fertilized embryo is transferred to the womanâ€™s uterus. The IVF process is a very expensive. This project utilized R programming language to conduct statistical analysis on IVF success rates and factors to help an individual make decisions on whether in vitro fertilization is a good choice for them.

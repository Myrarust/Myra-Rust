## About

I am an aspiring data scientist looking to leverage my past experience and current education in a new and exciting career. I discovered data science after leaving my career in software integration, test, and QA to be a stay-at-home mom for my wonderful daughter and I fell in love with it! Data science compliments my natural analytical personality and I enjoy using technology and machine learning to solve problems and provide answers. 

## Projects

Please take a look at some of my favorite projects I completed during my Data Science Master's program. These projects span a variety of different domains and demostrate my capabilities in Python, data wrangling, machine learning, predictive analysis, and data visualization.

      <h3>Statistical Analysis of IVF Success Rates</h3>
      <p>
         Many women have difficulty becoming pregnant and look to assisted reproductive procedures to help with conceiving a child. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of the procedures available. During the IVF procedure, an egg is retrieved from the woman, fertilized in a laboratory, then the fertilized embryo is transferred to the womanâ€™s uterus. The IVF process is a very expensive. This project utilized R programming language to conduct statistical analysis on IVF success rates and factors to help an individual make decisions on whether in vitro fertilization is a good choice for them.

      <h3>Airline Saftey Visualization Analysis</h3>
      <p>
         Scenario: A slew of recent airline accidents had people worried about airline safety. As a person employed for an airline, I was tasked with creating a number of visualizations that relayed the facts about airline safety. I created a dashboard for fellow employees, a blog post and infographic for the public, and an executive summary and final presentation for management. Click on the links below to view the products:
